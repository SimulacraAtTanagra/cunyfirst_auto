## The purpose of this project is as follows:<br />This project, which is a work in progress, automates data entry, correction, deletion, and other actions in CUNYfirst (a peoplesoft product).<br />## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:<br />CUNYfirst data entry, auditing, and maintenance is laborious, boring, time-consuming and necessary. Automating it is a way to free up time not only for myself and people on my team but potentially for other campuses that are in a similar position.<br />##This project leverages the following libraries:<br />pandas, fuzzywuzzy, selenium, webdriver_manager, xlrd<br />##In order to use this, you'll first need do the following:<br />If you are preparing to use this script, do not.

As of this writing, the most up to date (and fully functional) portion of this is the deletion_new method for the jobpages class. Please, please, please do not attempt to use any of this so long as this readme includes this paragraph.<br />##The expected frequency for running this code is as follows:<br />As needed
